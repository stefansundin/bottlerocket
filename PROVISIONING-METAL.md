# Provisioning Bottlerocket on metal

This guide will describe what is needed to properly provision Bottlerocket on bare metal.
Provisioning Bottlerocket on metal is different than provisioning other general-purpose distros.
Since Bottlerocket has a `dm-verity`-checked boot and root partition, and is immutable at runtime, a user cannot provision an image and directly write configuration files.
Bottlerocket requires a few files to be generated and written to disk at provisioning time in order to boot properly; these files are described below.

For more information about the hardware that Bottlerocket for bare metal is currently tested on, see [SUPPORTED-HARDWARE](SUPPORTED-HARDWARE.md).

## High level provisioning steps

The high level steps to provision Bottlerocket images for bare metal to your host are below.
Most provisioning systems provide methods to achieve the following:

* Decompress (`unlz4`) and write the Bottlerocket image to the desired disk
* Mount the `BOTTLEROCKET-PRIVATE` partition (partition 12)
* Write the below files to the mounted partition (these files are further described below):
  * (Required) [`user-data.toml`](#user-data)
  * (Required) [`net.toml`](#network-interface-configuration)
  * (Optional, recommended) [`bootconfig.data`](#boot-configuration)
* Reboot

### Fetch the Bottlerocket image for bare metal

The Bottlerocket image for bare metal is signed and uploaded alongside the rest of the Bottlerocket release artifacts.

You first need the Bottlerocket root role, which is used by `tuftool` to verify the image.
The following will download and verify the root role itself:

```shell
curl -O "https://cache.bottlerocket.aws/root.json"
sha512sum -c <<<"b81af4d8eb86743539fbc4709d33ada7b118d9f929f0c2f6c04e1d41f46241ed80423666d169079d736ab79965b4dd25a5a6db5f01578b397496d49ce11a3aa2  root.json"
```

Next, set your desired version and variant, and use `tuftool` to download the image:
To install `tuftool` you'll need to install Rust (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or the official site), and then you can run `cargo install tuftool`.

```shell
ARCH="x86_64"
VERSION="v1.9.0"
VARIANT="metal-k8s-1.23"
IMAGE="bottlerocket-${VARIANT}-${ARCH}-${VERSION}.img.lz4"
OUTDIR="${VARIANT}-${VERSION}"

tuftool download "${OUTDIR}" --target-name "${IMAGE}" \
   --root ./root.json \
   --metadata-url "https://updates.bottlerocket.aws/2020-07-07/${VARIANT}/x86_64/" \
   --targets-url "https://updates.bottlerocket.aws/targets/"
```

### User data

Bottlerocket for bare metal expects a TOML-formatted file named `user-data.toml` that contains user data settings.
Acceptable settings can be found in the [settings docs](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#settings).

If you're just getting started and want to provision a host without connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following example user data which will start `kubelet` in standalone mode.

```toml
[settings.kubernetes]
standalone-mode = true
```

For remote access to your running Bottlerocket hosts, you will need to add user data to enable host containers.
The Bottlerocket images for bare metal don't enable any host containers by default.
You can use our [admin](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container) and/or [control](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container) containers, but they need to be configured first.
Full configuration details are covered in the [admin container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container#authenticating-with-the-admin-container) and the [control container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container#connecting-to-aws-systems-manager-ssm).

### Network interface configuration

Bottlerocket for bare metal provides the means to configure the physical network interfaces in the system via TOML-formatted file `net.toml`.
For now, simple DHCP4 and DHCP6 configuration is supported with plans to support additional configuration in the future.

`net.toml` is read at boot time and generates the proper configuration files in the correct format for each interface described; no default configuration is provided.
If no network configuration is provided, boot-time services like host containers, `containerd`, and `kubelet` will fail to start.
When these services fail, your machine will not connect to any cluster and will be unreachable via host containers.

#### `net.toml` structure

The configuration file must be valid TOML and have the filename `net.toml`.
The first and required top level key in the file is `version`; the latest is version `2`.
The rest of the file is a map of interface name to supported settings.
Interface names are expected to be correct as per `udevd` naming, no interface naming or matching is supported.
(See the note below regarding `udevd` interface naming.)

#### Supported interface settings

* `primary` (boolean): Use this interface as the primary network interface. `kubelet` will use this interface's IP when joining the cluster.  If none of the interfaces has `primary` set, the first interface in the file is used as the primary interface.
* `dhcp4` (boolean or map): Turns on DHCP4 for the interface.  If additional DHCP4 configuration is required, the following settings are supported and may be provided as a map with the following keys:
  * `enabled` (boolean, required): Enables DHCP4.
  * `route-metric` (integer): Prioritizes routes by setting values for preferred interfaces.
  * `optional` (boolean): the system will request a lease using this protocol, but will not wait for a valid lease to consider this interface configured.
* `dhcp6` (boolean or map): Turns on DHCP6 for the interface.  If additional DHCP6 configuration is required, the following settings are supported and may be provided as a map with the following keys:
  * `enabled` (boolean, required): Enables DHCP6.
  * `optional` (boolean): the system will request a lease using this protocol, but will not wait for a valid lease to consider this interface configured.

As of version `2` static addressing with simple routes is supported via the below settings.
Please keep in mind that when using static addresses, DNS information must be supplied to the system via user data: [`settings.dns`](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#network-settings).
* `static4` (map): IPv4 static address settings.
  * `addresses` (list of quoted IPv4 address including prefix): The desired IPv4 IP addresses, including prefix i.e. `["192.168.14.2/24"]`.  The first IP in the list will be used as the primary IP which `kubelet` will use when joining the cluster.  If IPv4 and IPv6 static addresses exist, the first IPv4 address is used.
* `static6` (map): IPv6 static address settings.
  * `addresses` (list of quoted IPv6 address including prefix): The desired IPv6 IP addresses, including prefix i.e. `["2001:dead:beef::2/64"]`.  The first IP in the list will be used as the primary IP which `kubelet` will use when joining the cluster.  If IPv4 and IPv6 static addresses exist, the first IPv4 address is used.

* `route` (map): Static route; multiple routes can be added. (cannot be used in conjuction with DHCP)
  * `to` (`"default"` or IP address with prefix, required): Destination address.
  * `from` (IP address): Source IP address.
  * `via` (IP address): Gateway IP address.  If no gateway is provided, a scope of `link` is assumed.
  * `route-metric` (integer): Relative route priority.

Example `net.toml` with comments:

```toml
version = 2

# "eno1" is the interface name
[eno1]
# Users may turn on dhcp4 and dhcp6 via boolean
dhcp4 = true
dhcp6 = true
primary = true

# "eno2" is the second interface in this example
[eno2.dhcp4]
# `enabled` is a boolean and is a required key when
# setting up DHCP this way
enabled = true
# Route metric may be supplied for IPv4
route-metric = 200

[eno2.dhcp6]
enabled = true
optional = true

[eno3.static4]
addresses = ["10.0.0.10/24", "11.0.0.11/24"]

# Multiple routes may be configured
[[eno3.route]]
to = "default"
via = "10.0.0.1"
route-metric = 100

[[eno3.route]]
to = "default"
via = "11.0.0.1"
route-metric = 200

[eno4.static4]
addresses = ["192.168.14.5/24"]

# Using a source IP and non-default route
[[eno4.route]]
to = "10.10.10.0/24"
from = "192.168.14.5"
via = "192.168.14.25"
```

**An additional note on network device names**

Interface name policies are [specified in this file](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/release/80-release.link#L6); with name precedence in the following order: onboard, slot, path.
Typically on-board devices are named `eno*`, hot-plug devices are named `ens*`, and if neither of those names are able to be generated, the “path” name is given, i.e `enp*s*f*`.

### Boot Configuration

Bottlerocket for bare metal uses a feature of the Linux kernel called [Boot Configuration](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/bootconfig.html), which allows a user to pass additional arguments to the kernel command line at runtime.
An immediate use of this feature for most users is setting `console` settings so boot messages can be seen on the appropriate consoles.

In order to make use of this feature, an initrd is created with the desired settings encoded inside it.
The initrd is empty save for the encoded boot config data.
To create the initrd, you must first create a configuration file containing key value pairs for the settings you would like to pass to kernel / init.
Full syntax is described in the [Boot Config documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/bootconfig.html#config-file-syntax), but a simple example is provided below that shows the format of console settings as well as an example `systemd` parameter.

The two acceptable prefixes to settings are `kernel` and `init`.
Settings prefixed with `kernel` are added to the beginning of the kernel command line.
Settings prefixed with `init` are added to the kernel command line after the `--`, but before any existing init parameters.

In the example below, two console devices are set up, and `systemd`'s log level is set to `debug`.

Example Boot Configuration:

```
kernel {
    console = tty0, "ttyS1,115200n8"
}
init {
    systemd.log_level = debug
}
```

The Bottlerocket SDK provides the `bootconfig` CLI tool, which is used to create a Boot Configuration initrd.
To create the Boot Configuration initrd, create a config file named `bootconfig-input` containing your desired key/value pair kernel and init arguments.

Then run the following (you will need Docker installed):

```shell
ARCH=$(uname -m)
SDK_VERSION="v0.26.0"
SDK_IMAGE="public.ecr.aws/bottlerocket/bottlerocket-sdk-${ARCH}:${SDK_VERSION}"

touch $(pwd)/bootconfig.data

docker run --rm \
   --network=none \
   --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
   --security-opt label:disable \
   -v $(pwd)/bootconfig-input:/tmp/bootconfig-input \
   -v $(pwd)/bootconfig.data:/tmp/bootconfig.data \
   "${SDK_IMAGE}" \
   bootconfig -a /tmp/bootconfig-input /tmp/bootconfig.data
```

The above command will create the properly named initrd `bootconfig.data` in your current directory.
This is the file you will write to disk during provisioning.

You can list a `bootconfig.data`'s contents, which also validates its format, by running:

```shell
ARCH=$(uname -m)
SDK_VERSION="v0.26.0"
SDK_IMAGE="public.ecr.aws/bottlerocket/bottlerocket-sdk-${ARCH}:${SDK_VERSION}"

docker run --rm \
   --network=none \
   --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
   --security-opt label:disable \
   -v $(pwd)/bootconfig.data:/tmp/bootconfig.data \
   "${SDK_IMAGE}" \
   bootconfig -l /tmp/bootconfig.data
```
